## Detailed Blueprint

1. **Project Setup**
   - **Initialize the project** with `npm init -y`.
   - **Install dependencies**:
     - `parcel` as the bundler.
     - `tailwindcss` for styling.
     - `jest` (or another testing framework like `vitest`) for TDD.
   - **Configure Tailwind**:
     - Create a basic `tailwind.config.js`.
     - Include Tailwind directives in a `styles.css` (e.g., `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`).
   - **Parcel Configuration**:
     - Confirm that your entry point (`index.html`) references your main JS file and the compiled CSS from Tailwind.

2. **Basic Structure & Layout**
   - **`index.html`**: Skeleton HTML with a container for the flashcard, navigation buttons, and a progress display.
   - **`src/app.js`**: Main JavaScript that handles the core logic (rendering letters, next button, progress).
   - **`tests/app.test.js`**: Initial test file to verify that the code can be imported and tested properly.

3. **Incremental Functionality**
   1. **Render a Single Letter**  
      - Hardcode a single letter and confirm it displays.
      - Write a test to ensure the function `renderLetter()` returns or sets a DOM element with the expected letter.
   2. **Add Navigation (Next Button)**  
      - Introduce a button to move to the next letter.
      - Write a test ensuring that `nextLetter()` updates the index and calls `renderLetter()`.
   3. **Progress Tracking**  
      - Implement a simple progress counter that increments each time you press “Next”.
      - Test that `progress` value is incremented and displayed properly.
   4. **Multiple Languages & Single-Language View**  
      - Introduce data objects for letters in English, Spanish, Japanese.
      - Display only the active language. For now, pick a default (e.g., English).
      - Test that the correct letter is shown, based on the current language.
   5. **Audio Toggle**  
      - Add a button to turn audio on/off.
      - Store audio files or placeholders in the code.  
      - Test that `playAudio()` is called only when audio is on.
   6. **Progressive Learning Logic**  
      - Implement a subset of letters that grows as the user cycles through them successfully.
      - Test that completing a round of the subset triggers an expansion or “mastery” logic.
   7. **Final Polish**  
      - Confirm layout is styled nicely in Tailwind, gestures are smooth, TDD coverage is good.
      - Optional: Add swipe detection library or maintain simple click/tap.

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Maintain test files next to your source or in a separate `tests` folder.
   - For each feature, write tests first, then implement the code until tests pass.
   - Keep tests granular: each function or module has specific tests.

5. **Summary of Tools & Best Practices**
   - **Parcel** for zero-config bundling.
   - **Tailwind** for rapid UI styling.
   - **Jest** for test-driven development.
   - **Incremental, test-first approach** to catch issues early.

## Iterative Development Chunks

1. **Chunk 1**: Project Initialization
   - Create `package.json`, install parcel, tailwind, jest, set up scripts, create a minimal `index.html`, `src/app.js`, and `tests/app.test.js`.
2. **Chunk 2**: Simple Render
   - Implement a function that returns a single letter to display.
   - Test it using Jest (verify the function returns the expected string).
3. **Chunk 3**: DOM Manipulation
   - Add DOM code to inject that letter into the page.
   - Write a test that simulates or checks if the DOM gets updated.
4. **Chunk 4**: Navigation
   - Add a “Next” button and logic to cycle through a small array of letters.
   - Test to ensure the index increments and the displayed letter updates.
5. **Chunk 5**: Progress Tracking
   - Keep count of how many letters you’ve seen or how many times you pressed “Next”.
   - Test the increment logic and that the counter is displayed properly on the DOM.
6. **Chunk 6**: Languages
   - Introduce a data structure for multiple languages.
   - Show only the active language’s letter. Store a simple variable for current language.
   - Test that switching or displaying the correct language works.
7. **Chunk 7**: Audio Toggle
   - Add a button for toggling audio.
   - Test that audio is only played when toggle is ON.
8. **Chunk 8**: Progressive Learning
   - Start with a subset (e.g., 1 letter). After a cycle, expand to the next letter, etc.
   - Test the logic that increments your “subset size” after each cycle.
9. **Chunk 9**: Final Integration
   - Fine-tune UI, fix any test coverage gaps, finalize user flow.
   - Test final user interactions thoroughly (multi-language transitions, audio toggle, progress).

## Series of Prompts for a Code-Generation LLM

Below are the prompts you can paste into a code-generation tool. Each prompt focuses on a specific stage of development. They assume a TDD workflow: you’ll prompt for tests first, then prompt for implementation, then refine.

---

### **Prompt 1: Project Initialization**

```text
You are setting up a new project called "Letter Swipe." 
Tasks:
1. Initialize a Node project (npm init).
2. Install parcel, tailwindcss, jest.
3. Generate a minimal folder structure:
   - index.html
   - src/app.js
   - tests/app.test.js
4. Configure Tailwind and Parcel so that styles compile and load correctly.
5. Provide a full directory listing and the minimal file contents.
6. Include instructions for how to run "npm test" (Jest) and "npm start" (Parcel).
```

---

### **Prompt 2: Test for Rendering a Single Letter**

```text
Now that the project is set up, write a Jest test suite for a function "renderLetter(letter)" 
which should eventually inject a letter into the DOM or return a string. 
1. Create a test file "tests/renderLetter.test.js".
2. Write tests that check:
   - "renderLetter('A')" returns or creates 'A'.
   - Any invalid input throws an error or returns a default.
Do not implement the function yet; only write failing tests using TDD approach.
```

---

### **Prompt 3: Implement Basic renderLetter**

```text
Write the minimal implementation for "renderLetter(letter)" that satisfies the tests from 'renderLetter.test.js'.
1. In 'src/app.js', export a function "renderLetter" that passes all the existing tests.
2. Ensure we can import it in the test file.
3. Show updated file contents for "src/app.js" and any relevant changes in "tests/renderLetter.test.js".
```

---

### **Prompt 4: DOM Integration Tests**

```text
We want to confirm that "renderLetter" updates the DOM. 
1. Modify or extend 'renderLetter.test.js' to create a mock DOM or use something like jest-dom.
2. Test that calling "renderLetter('B')" updates an element with id "card" to display "B".
3. Do not implement yet—just provide failing test code.
```

---

### **Prompt 5: Implement DOM Rendering**

```text
Now implement DOM updates so the test passes:
1. In 'src/app.js', assume there's an element with id "card" in the DOM.
2. "renderLetter(letter)" should insert the text content into #card.
3. Show the updated code, ensuring you don’t break earlier tests.
```

---

### **Prompt 6: Next Button Tests**

```text
We want a "nextLetter()" function that cycles through a small array ["A","B","C"].
1. In a new test file "tests/nextLetter.test.js", write tests that:
   - Ensure nextLetter() increments the current index.
   - Calls renderLetter() with the new letter.
   - Resets to the first letter after the last letter.
2. Write only the tests, no implementation yet.
```

---

### **Prompt 7: Implement nextLetter**

```text
Implement the "nextLetter()" function in 'src/app.js':
1. Store a global or module-level array of letters, e.g. ["A","B","C"].
2. Keep track of an index that cycles through them.
3. After updating the index, call "renderLetter()".
4. Provide updated code that passes the tests in nextLetter.test.js.
```

---

### **Prompt 8: Progress Tracking Tests**

```text
Add a progress counter that increments each time "nextLetter()" is called, 
and displays in an element with id "progressCount" in the DOM.
1. Create or update a test file "tests/progress.test.js" for TDD.
2. Check that progress is 0 initially, then increments after nextLetter() is called.
3. Ensure the #progressCount element updates as well.
4. Tests only—no implementation yet.
```

---

### **Prompt 9: Implement Progress Tracking**

```text
Implement the progress tracking:
1. In 'src/app.js', create a variable "progress = 0".
2. Each time nextLetter() runs, increment it.
3. Update "document.getElementById('progressCount')" to show the new value.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Provide the updated code, referencing existing test files.
```

---

### **Prompt 10: Multilingual Setup Tests**

```text
We now want to handle multiple languages (English, Spanish, Japanese) per letter. 
We’ll still show only one language at a time. 
1. Create or update "tests/multilingual.test.js".
2. Write tests ensuring there's a data structure like:
   [
     { en: 'A', es: 'A', jp: 'あ' },
     { en: 'B', es: 'B', jp: 'い' }
   ]
3. Write a test verifying "setLanguage('en')" shows the English letter for the current index, etc.
4. Tests only—no implementation.
```

---

### **Prompt 11: Implement Multilingual Support**

```text
Implement multilingual logic in 'src/app.js':
1. Introduce an array of objects with en, es, jp fields.
2. A function "setLanguage(lang)" that changes a module-level variable currentLanguage.
3. Adjust nextLetter() and renderLetter() to use the correct language field.
4. Provide updated code and confirm all tests pass.
```

---

### **Prompt 12: Audio Toggle Tests**

```text
We want a function "toggleAudio()" that enables/disables audio. 
When audio is ON, "renderLetter()" should play the corresponding audio file. 
1. Create "tests/audio.test.js" or append to an existing test file.
2. Test:
   - toggleAudio() changes an audioEnabled flag.
   - If audioEnabled, on calling renderLetter(), an audio track is played.
   - Use mock/stub for audio playback.
3. Only tests—no implementation yet.
```

---

### **Prompt 13: Implement Audio Toggle**

```text
Implement "toggleAudio()" and audio playback in 'src/app.js':
1. Keep a boolean "audioEnabled" = false by default.
2. toggleAudio() flips the boolean.
3. If audioEnabled && data[currentIndex].audio exists, play it in renderLetter().
4. Provide updated code to pass the tests.
```

---

### **Prompt 14: Progressive Learning Tests**

```text
We want to start with a subset (e.g., 1 letter) and expand it after each complete cycle. 
1. In "tests/progressive.test.js", write tests verifying we have a "currentSubsetSize" that starts at 1.
2. After cycling through the subset, it increments to 2, etc., up to the full array length.
3. Only tests—no implementation yet.
```

---

### **Prompt 15: Implement Progressive Learning**

```text
Implement the progressive learning logic in 'src/app.js':
1. Let "currentSubsetSize = 1".
2. Once the user cycles through that subset, increase currentSubsetSize by 1.
3. Ensure we don't exceed the array length.
4. Ensure all tests pass, and show the final code for relevant sections.
```

---

### **Prompt 16: Final Polish**

```text
Now that all core functionality is tested and implemented, provide:
1. The final app.js with all functions (renderLetter, nextLetter, setLanguage, toggleAudio, etc.).
2. A final index.html referencing the bundle, plus Tailwind classes for styling the flashcard, buttons, and progress text.
3. Confirm that we can run "npm run build" to produce the final bundled code with Parcel, and "npm test" to confirm coverage.
```

**Use the above prompts in sequence with your code-generation LLM, verifying each step passes tests before moving to the next. This ensures a robust, test-driven build process for your “Letter Swipe!” game using Parcel, plain JS, and Tailwind CSS.**
